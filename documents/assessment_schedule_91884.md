# **Evidence/Judgements for Achievement/Paetae**
### Use basic iterative processes to develop a digital outcome.

The student:

- Plans a digital outcome to address a problem, need, opportunity or interest.
>**For example (partial evidence):**_The student researches issues relating to their chosen task, examines user preferences and plans how they are going to incorporate these through creating sketches and interactive wireframes. The student has used an online tool to plan out the development process._

- Develops the digital outcome by decomposing the problem
>**For example (partial evidence):**_The student decomposes their basic computer game into the components that need to be developed and tested such as graphics, functions, user interface, etc._

- Plans and trials components of the outcome in an iterative manner.
>**For example (partial evidence):**_The student plans and tests the code for their program. They next plan and test the data received from their API. They next plan and test the way the result is presented to the user. They check that the program is easy to use and understand. Each component is planned and tested in an iterative manner until the final outcome is produced._

- Tests that the programming outcome functions as intended
>**For example (partial evidence):**_The student plans testing the functionality of the program with various users to ensure it works._

- Describes the social implications and end-user considerations that are relevant to the outcome.
>**For example (partial evidence):**_The student spoke to students from their target audience to determine their needs. The student recognises that it is unethical to use copyrighted data. They have recognised that presentation of the UI will affect the enjoyment of using the program. However, the student may not have chosen the best solution to address the considerations or could have more fully addressed these considerations._

# **Evidence/Judgements for Achievement with Merit/Kaiaka**
### Use basic iterative processes to develop an informed digital outcome.

The student:
- Uses information from testing and trialling to improve the outcome.
>**For example (partial evidence):**_The student provides screenshots with a brief annotation that shows the improvements in the program mechanics that were made after making changes. They also provide a short video to demonstrate improved functionality after correcting a bug in the code._

- Trials multiple components and/or techniques and selects those which ensure the outcome functions as intended.
>**For example (partial evidence):**_The student trials two different techniques for performing a particular aspect of their program and selects the choice that does not cause functionality issues. The student trials two different question generating techniques and chooses the one that is most efficient._

- Addresses the social implications and end-user considerations that are relevant to the outcome.
>**For example (partial evidence):**_The student addresses that fact that it is unethical to use copyrighted questions by making up their own questions / using creative commons material that has been correctly attributed. They also ensure that any images used in the program are copyright free. They have addressed usability and aesthetic considerations through testing their game with a range of end users._

# **Evidence/Judgements for Achievement with Excellence/Kairangi**

### Use basic iterative processes to develop a refined digital outcome.

The student:

- Applying information from planning, testing and trialling of components to develop a high quality outcome.
>**For example (partial evidence):**_The student has provided evidence that their planning has allowed them to meet project timelines and include all the planned for components and information. Their outcome functions as intended and has no obvious errors in functionality or presentation of the information. Evidence gained from trialling and thorough and organised testing has been integrated into the outcome in an **ongoing** manner to ensure the outcome is of high quality, including aesthetics, functionality and usability._
